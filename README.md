A repository to place few noteworthy assignments I completed during my master's in data science and analytics at UCC. 

1. Assignment 1: Basic Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with hyper-parameter tuning using Random Search and TensorBoard.
2. Assignment 2: Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based auto-encoder to remove noise from images.
3. Assignment 3: Understanding and building a small transformer.
